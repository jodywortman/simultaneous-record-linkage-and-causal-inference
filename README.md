# simultaneous-record-linkage-and-causal-inference
This repo contains code for the paper "Simultaneous Record Linkage and Causal Inference with Propensity Score Subclassification."

There are two files- one contains code for most of the simulations, and the other contains code for the two non-constant treatment effect simulations. The simulations are run in similar ways, but some sections will need to be commented or un-commented to align with the descriptions in the paper.
